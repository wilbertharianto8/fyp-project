# Programmatic Similiarity Checker

Based on the work of CheckSim, this project is not a novel
implementation of any similarity checking algorithm. Rather this
project is an attempt to create a simplified, and generic, user
interface to existing algorithms.

## Current State

Currently under active development. Not production ready.

## How to Use

1. Create a zip file containing all projects to compare
